## Buoywatch
[Buoywatch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buoywatch-noaa-surf-buoys/id1479691525) is an iOS & Apple Watch app made using **SwiftUI** and **Combine** as I've been playing around with the latest Apple frameworks since day one after the WWDC.
It allows you to get real-time marine buoys data and get aware when the surf is good at a glance.
Too often swell arrives later than predicted, by checking the buoy data you can determine if the swell has arrived. If not, you can go back to bed =)
